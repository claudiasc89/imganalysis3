## 🎉 Exciting News: My Image Analysis Portfolio Site is Now Live! 🚀

I’m thrilled to announce the launch of my new website dedicated to showcasing my work in image analysis! This platform is a space where I’ll be sharing my passion for transforming raw image data into meaningful insights through various analytical techniques.

My goal with this site is to not only highlight the projects I’ve completed but also to provide a deeper understanding of the methods and scripts I use to achieve these results. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast, a potential collaborator, or just curious about image analysis, I hope you find something here that sparks your interest.

Over time, I’ll be progressively sharing more of the scripts and tools I’ve developed, walking you through the process behind each analysis. Stay tuned for regular updates, detailed breakdowns, and new projects as they come to life.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Your feedback, questions, and suggestions are always welcome. Let's dive into the world of image analysis together!
