What is an image? In image analysis, an image is a collection of data that represents visual information. When imported into a coding environment, this visual information is converted into an array of pixels. Each pixel in this array has a specific intensity value that represents the brightness at that point in the image.

## Pixel intensity values

For 8-bit images, the pixel values range from 0 to 255. In microscopy, we usually work with 16-bit images because they offer a higher bit depth. In other words, the pixel values range from 0 to 65535, allowing for finer gradations of intensity.
